Serve1.py and top_parser1.py both reside in the main folder on the server side. Top_parser1 will save plots, graphs, tcpdump and top outputs to a Results subfolder in the main folder.
Test1.py goes into the attacker main folder, it also saves plots etc to a Results subfolder. Scapy1 is used to process pcap outputs when wireshark does not do the trick. Thats pretty much it.
